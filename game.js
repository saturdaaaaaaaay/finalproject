/*
Learn how to import and use data from Tiled Editor.

Hexi supports game maps and levels created using the popular Tiled
Editor level designer:

www.mapeditor.org

To prepare your Tiled Editor game world for use in Hexi, give any significant thing a
`name` property. Anything with a `name` property in Tiled Editor can
be accessed in your code by its string name, as you'll see ahead. Tiled Editor layers have a
`name` property by default, and you can assign custom `name`
properties to tiles and objects.

Open `maps/timeBomPanic.tmx` file in Tiled Editor and take a careful
look at how it's been structured. Notice how sprites have been
organized into layers, and how those layers have been named and
stacked. Also, notice that the tileset images of the player and bomb
both have custom `name` properties: "player" and "bomb".

    Prevent the player from walking through walls using the
    versatile `hitTestTile` method. `hitTestTile` checks for a
    collision between a sprite and a tile in any map array that you
    specify. It returns a `collision` object.
    `collision.hit` is a Boolean that tells you if a sprite is colliding
    with the tile that you're checking. `collision.index` tells you the
    map array's index number of the colliding sprite. You can check for
    a collision with the tile against "every" corner point on the
    sprite, "some" corner points, or the sprite's "center" point. (Each
    of these three options has a different and useful effect, so experiment with
    them.)

    `hitTestTile` arguments:
    sprite, array, collisionTileGridIdNumber, worldObject, spritesPointsToCheck

    The `world` object (the 4th argument) has to have these properties:
    `tileheight`, `tilewidth`, `widthInTiles`.

    `hitTestTile` will work for any map array, not just those made with
    Tiled Editor. So you can use it with your own game maps in the same way.
